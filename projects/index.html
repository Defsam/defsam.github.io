		<span>P.ML</span> huge project, what i’m “working on” rn. has taken FOREVER with little results. may include many smaller projects inside as a result of how it’s made
		<br><hr>
		<span>priv</span> making an archive of all my art/images thus far. almost done
		<br><hr>
		<span>twitter requests</span> big. want to redo a lot of them, though. lost a ton of interest after i failed to reconstruct 16 hours of corrupted work
		<br><hr>
		<span>discord requests</span> unmeasured. probably many i've forgotten about
